Make a real difference in your neighborhood.

TrashMob connects you with community cleanup events happening near you. Whether you want to organize a cleanup or join one, TrashMob makes it easy to take action against litter and build a cleaner world.

Find and join events
Browse cleanup events on an interactive map. See what's happening near you today, this week, or this month. One tap to RSVP and get directions.

Report litter
Spot a mess? Snap a photo to create a litter report. Your report appears on the community map so others can see problem areas and organize cleanups where they're needed most.

Track your route
Turn on route tracking during a cleanup to see exactly where you covered. Your path shows on the event map so the team can see the area cleaned.

See your impact
Your personal dashboard shows your stats: events attended, hours volunteered, bags collected, and litter reports submitted. Watch your impact grow with every cleanup.

Build a team
Create or join a team to track collective impact. Compete on leaderboards, coordinate events, and celebrate milestones together.

Pickup coordination
After a cleanup, drop pins where bags of trash are waiting. Hauling partners can see pickup locations and collect them — no bags left behind.
