# AI Assistant Command: Add New Project to Planning

**Purpose:** This file provides step-by-step instructions for AI assistants (Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to help add a new project to the TrashMob 2026 planning documentation.

---

## Command Format

When a user requests to add a new project, follow this structured process:

### User Request Pattern
- "Add a new project for [feature/initiative]"
- "Create a project spec for [feature]"
- "Document a new project: [description]"

---

## Step 1: Gather Project Information

Ask the user for the following information (use defaults if not provided):

### Required Information
1. **Project Title** (e.g., "Email Digest System")
2. **Business Rationale** (Why is this needed?)
3. **Priority** (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
4. **Estimated Size** (Very Small / Small / Medium / Large / Very Large)
5. **Risk Level** (Low / Medium / High / Very High)

### Optional Information
6. Dependencies on other projects
7. Key objectives (3-5 bullet points)
8. Success metrics
9. Known risks
10. Technical approach (if known)

---

## Step 2: Determine Project Number

1. Check existing projects in `Planning/Projects/` folder
2. Find the highest project number (currently 25)
3. Assign next sequential number (e.g., 26)

**Command to check:**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path Planning/Projects/ -Filter "Project_*.md" | 
    Sort-Object Name | 
    Select-Object -Last 5 Name
```

---

## Step 3: Create Project File

### File Naming Convention
`Planning/Projects/Project_[NUMBER]_[TITLE_WITH_UNDERSCORES].md`

Example: `Planning/Projects/Project_26_Email_Digest_System.md`

### Use Template
Copy structure from `Planning/Projects/_Project_Template.md`

### Fill in Sections

#### Header Table
```markdown
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | Not Started (or Planning if requirements are clear) |
| **Priority** | [From user input] |
| **Risk** | [From user input] |
| **Size** | [From user input] |
| **Dependencies** | [List project numbers and names] |
```

#### Business Rationale
- Explain the "why" in 2-4 paragraphs
- Connect to TrashMob's mission and strategic objectives
- Describe problem being solved or value being delivered

#### Objectives
Split into:
- **Primary Goals** (3-5 must-have outcomes)
- **Secondary Goals** (2-3 nice-to-have outcomes)

#### Scope
Organize into phases:
- **Phase 1 - [Name]** ([Timeline]): List of deliverables with checkboxes
- **Phase 2 - [Name]** ([Timeline]): Continue as needed

#### Out-of-Scope
- List 3-5 things explicitly NOT included
- Helps set boundaries and manage expectations

#### Success Metrics
- **Quantitative:** Specific numbers, percentages, targets
- **Qualitative:** Outcomes that can't be measured numerically

#### Dependencies
- **Blockers:** What must be done first
- **Enablers:** What this project unlocks

#### Risks & Mitigations
Table format:
```markdown
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [L/M/H] | [L/M/H/Critical] | [How to handle] |
```

#### Implementation Plan
Include:
- Data model changes (SQL if applicable)
- API changes (C# examples if applicable)
- Web UX changes
- Mobile changes (if applicable)

#### Rollout Plan
Week-by-week or phase-by-phase timeline

#### Open Questions
Format:
```markdown
1. **[Question]**
   **Recommendation:** [Suggestion]
   **Owner:** [Who should decide]
   **Due:** [When needed]
```

#### Related Documents
Cross-reference to:
- Other project files
- Technical designs
- PRD sections

#### Footer
```markdown
**Last Updated:** [Today's date]
**Owner:** [Team/person responsible]
**Status:** [Not Started/Planning]
**Next Review:** [Date]
```

```

---

## Step 5: Update Executive Summary (if major project)

For high-priority or large projects, update `Planning/Executive_Summary.md`:

### 5.1 Add to Roadmap Overview
If the project has a defined quarter, add to the appropriate section:

```markdown
### Q[X] ([Month-Month])
- **Project [NUMBER]:** [Title] ([brief description])
```

### 5.2 Update Priority Matrix (if applicable)
Add to the priority table:

```markdown
| **High** | ..., [NUMBER] ([Title]), ... |
```

---

## Step 6: Update TODO List

Update `Planning/TODO_Project_Extraction.md`:

Add to appropriate priority section:

```markdown
- [ ] **Project [NUMBER]** - [Title]
  - File: `Project_[NUMBER]_[Title].md`
  - Source: New project (not in original 2026 plan)
  - Status: [Status]
  - Timeline: [Timeline]
```

---

## Step 7: Update Risks Document (if high risk)

If Risk level is High or Very High, add to `Planning/Risks_and_Mitigations.md`:

### 7.1 Add Project-Specific Risk Section

```markdown
### PR-[N]: [Risk Title]

**Category:** [Technical/Organizational/External]
**Likelihood:** [Low/Medium/High]

[Full summary as shown in Step 9 template]

---

## Advanced: Integration with Existing Projects

If the new project relates to existing projects:

### Update Related Project Files

For each related project, add cross-reference:

```markdown
## Related Documents

- **[Project 26 - Email Digest](./Project_26_Email_Digest.md)** - Complements notification strategy
```

### Update Dependency Chains

If new project depends on others or others depend on it:

1. Update Dependencies section in all affected projects
2. Update Executive Summary dependency graph (if complex)
3. Note in README if critical path changes

---

## Quality Standards

### Code Examples
- Use C# for backend (.NET 10)
- Use TypeScript for frontend (React 18)
- Include XML documentation comments
- Show complete, runnable examples

### Documentation Style
- Clear, concise language
- Active voice preferred
- Bullet points for lists
- Tables for structured data
- Code blocks with language tags

### Cross-References
- Use relative paths for links
- Link to related projects by name and number
- Include PRD references if applicable
- Link to technical designs when they exist

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Project number conflicts
**Solution:** Use `Get-ChildItem` to check highest number, add 1

### Issue: Unclear business rationale
**Solution:** Ask user for more context, connect to strategic objectives

### Issue: Too many dependencies
**Solution:** Consider breaking into smaller projects

### Issue: Scope too large
**Solution:** Suggest phasing or splitting into multiple projects

### Issue: Duplicate functionality
**Solution:** Check if existing project covers this, suggest enhancement instead
