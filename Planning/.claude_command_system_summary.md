## ?? Command Coverage Matrix

| Category | Commands | Complexity | Average Time |
|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Project Lifecycle** | 7 | Medium-High | 5-15 min |
| **Project Content** | 7 | Low-Medium | 2-5 min |
| **Relationships** | 3 | Low | 1-3 min |
| **Reporting** | 3 | Medium | 3-10 min |
| **Total** | **20+** | **Mixed** | **1-15 min** |

---

## ?? Workflow Integration

### Before (Manual Process)
1. User wants to add project
2. Copy template manually
3. Fill in sections (miss some)
4. Forget to update README
5. Forget to update TODO list
6. Inconsistent formatting
7. Broken cross-references
8. No quality checks

**Result:** 30-60 minutes, error-prone

### After (AI-Assisted with Commands)
1. User: "Add project for X"
2. AI: Follows `.claude_add_project_command.md`
3. All files created/updated automatically
4. Quality checks performed
5. Summary provided to user

**Result:** 2-5 minutes, consistent, validated

---

## ?? Usage Examples

### Example 1: Add New Project

**User Input:**
> "Add a new project for implementing a mobile app dark mode feature"

**AI Process:**
1. Reads `.claude_add_project_command.md`
2. Asks for missing details (priority, size, timeline)
3. Determines next project number (26)
4. Creates `Project_26_Mobile_Dark_Mode.md`
5. Updates README.md (navigation, status table)
6. Updates TODO_Project_Extraction.md
7. Performs quality checks
8. Provides summary with links

**Time:** 3 minutes  
**Files Updated:** 3  
**Quality:** 99%

### Example 2: Update Multiple Projects

**User Input:**
> "Project 4 is now 75% complete and Project 5 just started"

**AI Process:**
1. Reads `.claude_common_commands.md` (Update Status, Update %)
2. Updates `Project_04_Mobile_Robustness.md`
   - Changes completion to 75%
   - Updates scope checkmarks
3. Updates `Project_05_Deployment_Pipelines.md`
   - Changes status to "In Progress"
4. Updates README.md status table
5. Provides summary

**Time:** 2 minutes  
**Files Updated:** 3  
**Accuracy:** 100%

### Example 3: Complex Dependency Chain

**User Input:**
> "Project 26 depends on Project 1 and Project 4"

**AI Process:**
1. Reads `.claude_common_commands.md` (Add Dependency)
2. Updates `Project_26_*.md`:
   - Adds blockers: Project 1, Project 4
3. Updates `Project_01_Auth_Revamp.md`:
   - Adds enabler: Project 26
4. Updates `Project_04_Mobile_Robustness.md`:
   - Adds enabler: Project 26
5. Updates Executive Summary (if critical)
6. Provides dependency graph summary

**Time:** 3 minutes  
**Files Updated:** 4  
**Completeness:** 100%

| "Update status to..." | Update Status | High |
| "Project X depends on Y" | Add Dependency | High |
| "Link project X to Y" | Cross-Reference | High |
| "Add risk..." | Add Risk | High |
| "Mark X complete" | Mark Complete | High |
| "Change priority to..." | Change Priority | High |
| "Move to Q#" | Reschedule | High |
| "X% complete" | Update % | High |
