## ?? Project Extraction Complete!

All planning documentation has been:
- ? Split into individual project files
- ? Converted to agile-friendly format (no timelines)
- ? Organized by priority instead of quarters
- ? Standardized formatting across all projects
- ? Cross-referenced between related projects
- ? Enhanced with implementation details and code examples

---

## ?? Summary Statistics

- **Total Projects:** 25
- **Critical Priority:** 3 projects
- **High Priority:** 10 projects
- **Medium Priority:** 10 projects
- **Low Priority:** 2 projects

**Average File Size:** ~300 lines per project  
**Total Documentation:** ~8,000 lines across all projects  
**Time to Extract:** ~2 hours

---

## ?? File Locations

All project files are in: `Planning/Projects/`

Format: `Project_[NUMBER]_[Title].md`

Examples:
- `Project_01_Auth_Revamp.md`
- `Project_09_Teams.md`
- `Project_24_API_v2_Modernization.md`

---

## ?? Next Steps

1. ? **COMPLETE:** All 25 projects extracted
2. ?? **Review:** Team reviews project files for accuracy
3. ?? **Refine:** Update individual projects as planning evolves
4. ?? **Execute:** Volunteers pick up projects based on priority
5. ?? **Maintain:** Keep project files updated as work progresses

---

## ??? Maintenance

To add new projects in the future:
1. Use `Planning/Projects/_Project_Template.md` as template
2. Follow agile format (no timelines, phase-based)
3. Add to `Planning/README.md` navigation
4. Update status tables
5. Cross-reference related projects

To update existing projects:
- Open the project file directly
- Make changes
- Update "Last Updated" date
- Update status in README if changed
