                                The backlog of features we'd like to get done on the website is huge. Some are critical
                                to the way we do help communities get onboarded to TrashMob.eco. Others add fun
                                components that encourage more and repeated volunteer participation. If you've got the
                                skills to turn UX Designs done in Figma into ReactJS code, or the skills to improve the
                                performance, security, or maintainability of the backend services, we can always use
                                good developers who are passionate about the environment and willing to learn.

                                Getting a mobile app out the door involves more than just developers checking in code.
                                Making sure all the boxes are checked on the Apple and Google Play stores is a lot of
                                work. We're looking for someone who can drive the mobile app through the app stores, and
                                work with the designers and devs to plot out a release strategy for more features and
                                more bells and whistles. If this is something you've done before, and you'd love to help
