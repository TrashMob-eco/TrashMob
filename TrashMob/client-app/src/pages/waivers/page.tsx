                            WAIVER AND RELEASE: I, the Volunteer, release and forever discharge and hold harmless the
                            Parties from any and all liability, claims, and demands of whatever kind or nature, either
                            in law or in equity, which arise or may hereafter arise as result of my participation in
                            such Events. I understand and acknowledge that this Release discharges from any liability or
                            claim that I may have with respect to bodily injury, personal injury, illness, death, or
                            property damage that may result from the Services I am providing by participating in the
                            Event.

                        <li>

                            limited to medical, health, or disability benefits or insurance of any nature in the event

                            from any claim whatsoever which arises or may hereafter arise on account of any first aid,
                            treatment, or service rendered by any person in connection with an emergency during my
                            tenure as a volunteer during the course of an Event.

                            used in its broadest sense and includes, but is not limited to natural hazards (land,
                            weather, etc.) and man-made hazards (concrete, steel, etc.). I understand and acknowledge
                            that participation may include Hazards that could harm me, and that such Hazards may or may
                            not always be obvious. I hereby expressly and specifically assume the risk of injury or harm
                            for all such Hazards.
