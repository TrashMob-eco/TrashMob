<h2>
    What does being a TrashMob.eco Partner Community mean?
</h2>
<p>
    There are a number of logistical challenges that TrashMob.eco Partners help the volunteers to overcome:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Where do they get starter kits? (buckets, litter pickers, gloves, safety vests)
        </li>
        <li>
            Where do they get safety gear and supplies]? (signs, bags)
        </li>
        <li>
            How do they get the picked litter from the cleanup location to the disposal site? Many volunteers don't have vehicles capable of hauling more than one or two bags of litter
            and often community picks can result in a dozen or more bags. Sometimes these picking locations are in areas where only vehicles with safety lights can stop.
            If you have trucks with safety lights and have a few minutes a week to help, that can go a long way to getting litter out of the community!
        </li>
        <li>
            How do they dispose of the litter? Most household garbage cans are small and might fit one bag of garbage, but as a local business, you may have a dumpster with excess capacity at the end of the week.
            Being a partner could be as simple as allowing TrashMob.eco to drop off a few bags of picked garbage in your dumpster a couple of times a month.
        </li>
        <li>
            How do they raise awareness of their efforts to clean up the community in order to attract more volunteers? Community Partners can help with social media and advertising to help build the number of volunteers active in the communuity.
        </li>

    TrashMob.eco provides a way for partners to declare which services you want to provide the volunteers, and automates the process by which users can request these services.

    When it comes to volunteers cleaning up litter in a community, there are a number of logistical challenges that TrashMob.eco helps the volunteers and communities to overcome:
    <ul>
        <li>Each volunteer with TrashMob.eco signs an online <a href="https://www.trashmob.eco/waivers">waiver</a>.</li>
        <li>As a 501(c)(3) volunteer organization, TrashMob.eco can sign Organizational Volunteer Agreements with communities so that the volunteers don't have to submit volunteer waivers with the city meaning less paperwork for your community to manage.</li>
        <li>
