    Your TrashMob.eco waiver is expiring soon! To continue participating in cleanup events, you'll need to sign a new waiver.
</p>
<p>
    Waivers are required for all participants to ensure everyone's safety and to protect both you and the event organizers.
    They expire at the end of each calendar year, so we need you to renew yours.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Renewing is easy:</b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Step 1:</b> Go to your <a href="https://www.trashmob.eco/mydashboard">TrashMob.eco Dashboard</a> and log in.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Step 2:</b> Look for the "My Waivers" card on your dashboard. If you have pending waivers to sign, you'll see a button to sign them.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Step 3:</b> Read through the waiver, type your legal name, and click "Sign Waiver" to complete the process.
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively, you can sign a new waiver when you register for your next event. The system will automatically prompt you to sign any required waivers.
