    One of the core features of TrashMob.eco is that we send you notifications when other people in your area create TrashMob.eco events.
    That's kinda the whole point, actually. By creating events, people are letting their neighbors know that they are going to be out there cleaning
    up the neighborhood, and would love some help! And that help comes from people like you!
</p>
<p>
    We've noticed that you haven't yet set your base location, and that makes it impossible for us to give you a heads up when events are created. Don't worry though, it's really easy to fix this! Just follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>
    <b>Step 1:</b> Go to your <a href="https://www.trashmob.eco/locationpreference">TrashMob.eco user location preference</a>. It will ask you to log in.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Step 2:</b> Click a location on the map to set your home location. You can drag and drop the pin to wherever you want. Don't worry, we'll <b>never</b> show this location to anyone else. We recommend putting it
    close enough to home to make sure you're sent notifications for events close to your neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Step 3:</b> Set the maximum distance that you are willing to travel for an event and specify whether or not you'd prefer to use miles or kilometers. You will only get notified for events which are created within the radius you specify.
    It's likely that you will never have to travel far to find an area that needs cleaning. Start close to home, and work out from there!

    We hope that setting this up helps you to connect with your neighbors and encourages everyone to get out and make a difference! Help us build up momentum by updating your settings today!
